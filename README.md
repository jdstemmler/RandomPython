Piss off your friends really bad!
## Install Required Packages
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Run Script
You can either run a file word-by-word:
```python
python spam-text.py -f bee-movie --mode words
```
```
According
to
all
known
laws
of
aviation
...
```
or line-by-line:
```python
python spam-text.py -f baby-one-more-time --mode lines
```
```
Oh baby, baby
Oh baby, baby
Oh baby, baby, how was I supposed to know
That something wasn’t right here?
Oh baby, baby, I shouldn’t have let you go
...
```

The script will give you a 5-second countdown which should give you enough time to move your cursor over to whichever window you would like to type the text in.
